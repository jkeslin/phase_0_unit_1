Hey Everyone!

Joey, thanks for getting the party started with the accountabila-buddy emails.  I look forward to getting to know you guys more and more throughout DBC.  Here's some basic info stuff about me:

Name: Jeff Keslin
Location: Chicago, IL
Favorite websites: (not necessarily the ones on my technical blog) FiveThirtyEight (www.fivethirtyeight.com), Regressing (http://regressing.deadspin.com/), Zappos (http://www.zappos.com/) (I like shoes).
Gregorc Thinking Style:  Concrete Sequential and Concrete Random.
Learning style: Multimodal
Link to my github stuff:  http://jkeslin.github.io/index.html

I've lived in Chicago for 3 years and I've been a high school math and physics teacher for 6 years.  I'm originally from Baltimore but grew up in Tennessee and studied Engineering at U. of Maryland.   I have a slight southern accent that I try to hide, but it comes out more if I've had a beer or 3.   

My love of problem solving and taking on new challenges led me to leave engineering to be a teacher 6 years ago, and the same itch has now led me to joining Dev Bootcamp.  I'm definitely a n00b to programming but I'm excited about embarking on this journey with you guys and learning from you.  I've been really impressed with and humbled by the work you guys have sent out so far.  

Hit me up anytime if you would like to pair up in person or via google+.  

Now that I'm finally done with these challenges (and watching game of thrones) I'm gonna go grade 156 quizzes on parallel and perpendicular lines before I go to sleep.  

Have a great night, and a happy coding!

Take a moment to reflect on reading other people's responses regarding their fears about DBC. How did that make you feel? Did you feel better, worse, or something else all together? How has your experience this week influenced your feelings? All feelings are welcome and ok. Just take a moment to think about it and write it down.

We seem to all of the same fear of feeling inadequate.  If that's the case, it's probably a sign that that fear is irrational.  Having shared those fears with each other will allow us to create a sense of community and support each other.
