## 2. [Open Source and Repo Setup](2_set_up_repo/readme.md) Reflection

* Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person
* Describe what open source means
* What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
* Assess the importance of using licenses
* What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

Creating a new repository on gitub is as simple as logining into github and clicking the "create new..." button on the top right had side of the page, assigning a name to the repo, and a assigning a licensing agreement.  Using the app on your mac you can then find your repository and click "clone to computer."

Open source means that the code that a program is written with can be seen and modified by the user.  I appreciate how companies like Mozilla and Wordpress (Automattic?) have found ways to be open source but can still offer products and services to people that allow them to make money.  This sort of crowd sourced software seems like it's becoming more popular and will be the business model of the future.  Great for people like us who are learning how to code and can be a part of a new project, or adjust an existing one to our liking.

Licenses are necessary for informing others what liberties they make take with your intellectual property.  Depending on the license, other people may be able to change your work, distribute your work, or profit from your work.  

"Aha" Moments: 
1.  Wordpress is brilliant.
2.  Creating a new repo is easy. 
3.  Need to figure out this push/pull stuff.  I'm guessing that's in the next challenge or two.
