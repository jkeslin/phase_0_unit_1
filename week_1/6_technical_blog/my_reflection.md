## 8. [Comparing Favorite Websites](8_technical_blog/readme.md) Reflection

Blog url: http://jkeslin.github.io/unit1_projects/week1_technical_blog.html

Reflect on the process of researching and writing a blog post. It doesn't have to be long. Did you enjoy this? Did you get comments or views? Did you find the blog helpful to your learning? Did you find it cumbersome? Which parts did you feel best about and which did you feel less certain about?

The blog was extemely helpful to my learning.  In fact the coolest thing about this learning process was actually seeing other people post their sites and seeing the cool things they had come up with and using their work as inspiration.  Without investigating their work I would have never learned (or thought to consider) how to make a semi-transparent background, or use google fonts, etc.  I know my css is very clunky right now and a lot of my work was typing things and pressing refresh and hoping for the best.  I feel like if I start from scratch on my next build I'll be able to do a better job of having more efficient code and not spend forever trying to figure out how to center an image or something simple like that!
