I had questions for just about every part of this challenge it seemed like!  w3schools.com was extremely helpful for syntax help.  I also have a book about html and css that I purchased a couple months ago that I was able to reference.  I also noticed from checking out other people's blogs that some started with a tag: meta charset="UTF-8".  I was curious about what this meant so I read a few articles that were helpful but they also reminded me of my lack of basic computer science related knowledge.  

In my exploration of what fonts were available to me I stumbled upon google fonts and learned how to use that to enhance my typography options.  I also didn't know the hexademical color as 3 digits trick (i.e. #FF3322 = #F32).

I think I'll need a lot more practice with divs/margins/padding before I'll be able to feel comfortable predicting the results of my css formatting without too much guess & check & hope & repeat.  

I enjoyed seeing the fruits of my labor and how the page turned out.  Aligning and sizing things properly was quite tedious.
