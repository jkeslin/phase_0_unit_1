Honestly, I had never really thought of the web and the internet as being different things.  And I didn't realize every website has an IP address and the domain name is just what we give it to make it easier to remember/find.  I'm sure that's an embarrassing thing to admit to anyone who knows anything about computer science.

"aha" moment (also embarrassing to admit): I had never really thought of Ruby as being the server-side programming language.  Because I had dabbled with Ruby and Javascript at the same time I always just thought of Ruby as a more intuitively written replacement for Javascript and not as something with a completely different function.
