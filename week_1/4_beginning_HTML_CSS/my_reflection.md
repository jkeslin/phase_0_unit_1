HTML seems pretty simplistic.  It seems like it's just a matter of knowning the tags and remembering the syntax.  Classes and IDs in CSS present a lot of possibilities for design and styling with maximum efficiency and consistency throughout your site.  I've used codeacademy's tutorials on HTML and CSS in the past and found them very helpful.
