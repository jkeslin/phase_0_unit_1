## 1. [Git and Github](1_get_started/readme.md) Reflection

* What struggles did you have setting up git and GitHub? What did you learn in the process?
* Write an explanation of and compare git and GitHub to a non-technical audience. 
* Describe what version control is and how GitHub helps with it.
* Why do developers use version control (git)? Does that make sense to you? Why or why not?
* What doesn't make sense? What does?

I did not have any struggles setting up Git or Github, but had many questions about how to use them and how they're intertwined. The tutorials and articles have been really helpful though I know I need much more practice using Git and Github to fully understand its capabilities and feel confident with using Git in the terminal, etc.   

Git is like a flashdrive where you've saved a version of a document you're working on everytime you make a change and if you want you can look back at previous versions and continue your work from there.  GitHub on the otherhand, can be accessed by others as if in the "cloud" and your changes plus theirs are saved and controlled at once.  It's like dropbox for programmers.  Or google docs for programmers, maybe? 

Programmers use version control because writing code requires experimentation and you may want to go back to the way things were before you went down the road toward some crazy idea that ended up not working.  

Version control and why programmers need it makes sense to me, but I still need to practice using Git to see it in action and feel confident that I know how it really works and when/how to push/pull when editing.
