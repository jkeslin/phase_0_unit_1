# U1.W2: Design, User Experience, and creating your website Reflection

My Website url: http://jkeslin.github.io/index.html

Discuss the following:
* What did you learn about design and user experience? 
* Do you like design and user experience? Was it fun working on your site, the plan, and/or the wireframe? (If you hated it, that's OK too)
* What was your process? What worked and didn't work?
* What would you like to add or change about the site next?
* Was it difficult to apply the material you learned? Did you find anything in your research you thought was super cool?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.


Trying to make the site responsive was a new challenge for me, but I enjoyed the mathematical puzzles that were involved.  The resources included were also very helpful.  I really enjoy the design aspect of web development and I know I spend way too much time fiddling with little details, I enjoy the process.  I used percentages for the images and divs, and also the margins between them.  Next I would like to change the font sizes to units of em instead of pixles.  And I would like to improve the look of the site on the iPhone and other mobile devices.  Although, I haven't tried it yet, I'm excited about trying to use pseudo elements and object positioning to create multiple layers that can interact with the user.  All of web development is super cool.
