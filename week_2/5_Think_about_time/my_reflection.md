# U1.W2: Thinking About Time Reflection

* What is your biggest time management challenge with during Phase 0? 

My biggest time management challenge during Phase 0 is balancing my dev bootcamp work with my current job. I'm often exhausted after a day of teaching and find it hard to sit down and plug away at a DBC challenge. I also feel guilt for chosing to work on DBC instead of writing a lesson for the next day, or grading papers or whatever might be necessary for school. This usually just ends with me procrastinating. I have a bad habit of thinking that the weekend will be enough time to get caught up with everything, but it's really not enough time if I want to have a healthy work/life balance.

* How will you combat that? 

I need to make an effort to put time aside each day to devote to DBC and not think of Monday - Thursday as the days that I'm a teacher and Friday - Sunday as the days that I'm a student. The work will feel significantly less overwhelming if I can eliminate some of the smaller obligations throughout the week.  (Also, the school year ends in 3 weeks. That'll be super helpful.) 

* What techniques will you try?

I don't have a lot of experience meditating but I can appreciate taking time to be mindful and give my mind a rest.  I need to change my mindset that being idle is wasting time, when in fact, it can be a form of productivity if it allows me to be in a better mindset the rest of the day.  I also like the idea of focusing on the MVP or "Minimum Viable Product" and starting small.  I've noticed my most productive days are the ones where I start the day with a small project continue from there.  Sometimes when I have so much to do I get overwhelmed and become paralyzed and end up doing nothing.  I need to focus on accomplishing one small goal and letting it build from there.

* What is your overall plan for Phase 0?

My plan is to set aside 30 minutes to an hour each day to accomplish small tasks from the phase 0 curriculum and continue working from there if time permits, but being mindful of my own tiredness and not sacrificing sleep or mental health for my work.
