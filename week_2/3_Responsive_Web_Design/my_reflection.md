# U1.W2: Responsive Design Reflection

* What is responsive web design? Do you like it?  Do you think it's a good practice? Why or why not?
* How do you think smartphones and tablets have changed web design? How do you think new technology will change web design in the future?
* How do you think visually impaired people use the web? Can they? Should we design and development for them?
* What ideas and concepts have resonated with you when learning about the web and design? What seems stupid or doesn't make sense?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.


A site that is designed to be "responsive" is able to be adapted to different browser window sizes and different devices with smaller screen resolutions and a typical desktop computer.  I do like it, and think it is good practice considering how often we now consumer information via mobile devices. Smart phones and tablets have definitely changed web design.  It seems like things are moving away from surfing the web via a browser and having a seperate app for all the content you're interested in.  The visually impaired should be considered when designing for the web.  Some ways to do that are to allow for inlarged text, be mindful of colors and contrast, and use keyboard shortcut keys for navigating.
