# U1.W2: Chrome Dev Tools Challenge Reflection

* Describe the Document Object Model? What about it makes sense to you? What doesn't? What seems good and bad about it?
* How did using Chrome Web Tools to look at your site and a wordpress.com site compare?
* Did you find Chrome Web Tools fun, helpful, or a pain to work with?
* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

The DOM (if I understand it correctly) is the structure and set of rules that reads your html and allows the browser to be able to read it. It also allows html and javascript and other programming languages to interact with each other.  Using Chrome dev tools allowed me to see how much redundant code I had in my css file.  It was fun to see be able to unobtrusively turn on and off particular lines of css and view the effects on the site live. It also helped illuminate how margins/padding work and how changing them affects the width of an object, etc.  A lot of it was eye opening.  Working with dev tools was fun and I use it often to make adjustments in css, or to explore someone else's site and see if I can learn new tricks from their code.
