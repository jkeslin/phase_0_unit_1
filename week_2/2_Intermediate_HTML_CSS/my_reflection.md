# U1.W2: Intermediate HTML and CSS Reflection

* What do you think about web standards? Are they good or bad?
* Does the standard structure make sense to you? Why or why not?
* Do you like the new HTML5 elements, such as `<header>`, `footer`, and `nav`? Why or why not?
* Why is reset.css necessary? 
* What browsers have you used? Did you ever notice that sites looked different in different browsers? Do you think it's good or bad that they do?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

Web standards are necessary so that web developers and software developers and browsers can all communicate with each other in the same language under the same rules.  Some of the standard structure makes sense to me.  Some of the standards regarding how margins/padding and block/inline work seem dated.  reset.css is necessary because html has built in standards that can complicate your layout and cause you to waste time trying to figure out why that unordered list is 40px too far to the right (for example).  I use Chrome most of the time, but have also used firefox a lot in the past.  The fact that websites can look different in different browswers means that there's extra work to do to make your site compatible for different browswers.
