        <h2>Why PP is important</h2>
        
        <p>We&#8217re all beginners in Dev Bootcamp.  This idea has definitely been pushed to the forefront after finishing 
            the first week of exercises.  Pair Programming is important in becoming better programmers because it gives 
            us the opportunity to work with other students, share ideas, ask questions, and overall help each other in 
            solving any of the challenges that we come across during our progress.  Through this pair programming, we&#8217re 
            able to voice out what problems we come across, adding another pair of eyes, which can help in finding a solution.</p>
        
        <p>More importantly, it helps establish a responsive learning community that is open amongst all the students. We create 
            a safe and open environment if we consider our own social and emotional intelligence while being direct and upfront 
            with others.</p>
            
        <p>Pair Programming helps us practice these ideas as we grow personally as well as grow as computer programmers.</p>

        <h2>Driver vs. Navigator</h2>
        
        <p>The “driver” of Pair Programming writes the code while the  “navigator” takes the lead and dictates the direction 
            and the focus. While both should be giving input on what is being written the driver should look to the navigator 
            as to what area of code the pair will be focused on. </p>
        
        <p>his does not mean that roles stay in place for the entire section. Usually happening organically, the switching 
            of both roles will happen and is also encouraged in order to create balance and share the load equally. </p>
