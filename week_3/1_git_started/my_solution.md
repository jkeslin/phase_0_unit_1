## Release 4: Git Workflow

- Push files to a remote repository
Here is the process for "git push"
1.  Create a repository on GitHub.
2.  Create a folder locally that will be used for your repository using "mkdir"
3.  run "git init"
4.  to commit changes use "git commmit -m"
5.  To push these changes to GitHub use "git remote add origin..."
6.  Now use "git push"

- Fetch changes
1.  Use "git fetch" to get changes from a remote repository
2.  Then use "git merge" to sync

- Commit locally
1.  Start with "git add" to chose a file for commit
2.  Use "git commit -m" or "git commit -a -m"

## Release 6: Reflection
Using the commandline for git is a little scary at first because it feels a little dark and mysterious and that you might do something catastrophic like lose all of your work or who knows what. I'd reached a nice comfortzone with the github app, but I understand the value of being able to use git in the terminal.  I'm starting to get the hang of it, but still need online resources as refreshers when I go back to the terminal.
