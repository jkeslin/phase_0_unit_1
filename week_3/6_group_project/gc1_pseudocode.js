// My role in the group is:
//Person 2: Pseudocode

// Here is my part of the challenge:

//Function name: sum

//Initialize function named "sum" that accepts an array as a parameter
//initialze variable "add" for adding terms
//for "i" is less than the length of the array
//add the value at the index of the array "i" to the variable "add"
//take result of loop and print the total


//Function name: mean

//Initialize function named "mean" that accepts an array as a parameter
//initialize variable "sum"
//for "i" is less than the length of the array
//add the value at index "i" to the variable "sum"
//take result of loop and divide by the length of the array
//print the result


//Function name: median

//Initialize function named "median" that accepts an array as a parameter
//Define variable "half" that finds half of the length of the array
//sort array in order from least to greatest
//if the modulus of half of the length of the array is not equal to zero
//then define the "median" as the value at the index of the array that is located at the value of "half" minus 0.5
//else
//calculate the "median" as the sum of the value of the index at "half" minus 1, and "half", and divide by 2.
//print results of "median"
