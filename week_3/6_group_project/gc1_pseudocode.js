// My role in the group is:
//Person 2: Pseudocode

// Here is my part of the challenge:

//Function name: sum

//Initialize function named "sum" that accepts an array as a parameter
//initialze variable "add" for adding terms
//for "i" is less than the length of the array
//add the value at the index of the array "i" to the variable "add"
//take result of loop and print the total


//Function name: mean

//Initialize function named "mean" that accepts an array as a parameter
//initialize variable "sum"
//for "i" is less than the length of the array
//add the value at index "i" to the variable "sum"
//take result of loop and divide by the length of the array
//print the result


//Function name: median

//Initialize function named "median" that accepts an array as a parameter
//Define variable "half" that finds half of the length of the array
//sort array in order from least to greatest
//if the modulus of half of the length of the array is not equal to zero
//then define the "median" as the value at the index of the array that is located at the value of "half" minus 0.5
//else
//calculate the "median" as the sum of the value of the index at "half" minus 1, and "half", and divide by 2.
//print results of "median"

//Reflection

//What was this experience like?
//Spliting up a project like this was something new to me.  I'm curious how often it works like this in the 
//tech world.  Luckily I was in a really great group who did a good job of creating and meeting deadlines.  
//They also did a fantastic job of communicating their work to the next person and writing things in a way that
//we can all work with.
//
//Was your group successful in passing the tests?
//Yes!
//
//What did you learn about writing user stories, pseudocoding, writing code, refactoring?
//Having to write pseudocode knowing that it was for someone else's interpretation and not my own forced me 
//to consider the little details of what I was writing and whether or not they really made sense or had enough
//information, or too much.  I can probably write better pseudocode now because of this experience.
